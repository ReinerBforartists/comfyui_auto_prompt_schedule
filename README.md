Auto Prompt Schedule helps you to generate the list of keyframes. So that you don't have to type it manually all the time. All you need is a list of text where each line represents one prompt. And the node then converts this list to a list of keyframes that can directly be used in the Prompt Schedule node. For example to have a batch to run several prompts one after another, and generate images for it. The node contains an example workflow for exactly this needs. See Example workflows folder.
